      through music but he has also provided Dan with a positive male role model
      and a friend. Tom’s passion for music and music therapy is evident in his

    <h2>A BRIEF DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
      Music therapy is an innovative treatment approach combining the
      multidimensional elements of music and of therapy approaches, to address
      cognitive, communicative, psychosocial and physical necessities for
      positive developmental growth, rehabilitation, or general well being. To
      become a music therapist one must obtain a degree in music therapy in
      which the student undergoes intense study into the discipline of music,
      psychology, biology, and music therapy core courses.

    <h2>MY APPROACH</h2>
    <p>
      My personal approach in providing music therapy is that I aim to
      understand, to the best of my ability, how life is perceived from the
      clients perspective. Next, I consider how, their strengths can aid their
      weaknesses and how our relationship can co-exist, through music, to
      promote positive outcomes in their life.<br /><br />

      It is imperative that I honour each client regardless of what his/her
      condition or challenge may be. I intend to make a dependable relationship
      with each client, one in which, they feel comfortable and desire to be
      apart of. In developing this relationship I establish goals for each
      client and a framework on how we will meet those goals. Goals tend to stay
      in tact, while the objectives may fluctuate as the relationship develops.
      When goals are met, new ones will be set. Even though the therapist is the
      one managing the sessions, the client can set goals as-well. I strive to
      be conscious of what the client is expressing to me, while considering how
      we can apply these expressions to meet their goals.
